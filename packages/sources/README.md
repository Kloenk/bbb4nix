This directory contains all sources for all projects.
Usually, there is `raw-source.nix` (autogenerated) which is `callPackage`d from `default.nix`.
`default.nix` applies patches and stuff so all packages use the exact same source and all patches are in one place.

The `version` file in each directory is auto-generated and used to generate `raw-source.nix`.

## Maintainer info

To add a package, just add it to the bottom of `generate.sh`, add a `default.nix` into your directory, and the rest of this repository will take care of it.

If you need a checkout of your project in the checkouts directory, check its readme.
